# Concentration_comparison
Script for plotting drug concentration at different microparticle location as a function of time.


## Overview
This script is used to plot drug concentration at different microparticle location as a function of time. For the simulations Dchi = 1e-14 cm2/s, Dpcl=1e-13 cm2/s, b=5%, and k=1.

## Scripts

* Plot_concentration_profiles.m This script reads the information from the datasheet and makes a figure composed of four concentration subplots.

## Data
* Concentration_comparison.xlsx This datasheet contains the concentration vs time data at four different microparticle position. At the center, at the middle of the core, at the interface, and at the middle of the shell.
