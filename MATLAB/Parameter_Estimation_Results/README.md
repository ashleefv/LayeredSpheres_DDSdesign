## Scripts

* Plots_Bev_50_IC.m This script reads the final parameter estimation results for bevacizumab from InitialGuesses_50_Simulations.xlsx and the output is a 2x2 plot comparing average and best results for COMSOL and MATLAB, and the error values obtained.
* Plots_Bev_100_IC.m This script reads the preliminary parameter estimation results for bevacizumab from InitialGuesses_100_Simulations.xlsx and the output is a 2x2 plot comparing average and best results for COMSOL and MATLAB, and the error values obtained.
* Plots_BSA_50_IC.m This script reads the final parameter estimation results for BSA from InitialGuesses_50_Simulations.xlsx and the output is a 2x2 plot comparing average and best results for COMSOL and MATLAB, and the error values obtained.
* Plots_BSA_100_IC.m This script reads the preliminary parameter estimation results for bevacizumab from InitialGuesses_100_Simulations.xlsx and the output is a 2x2 plot comparing average and best results for COMSOL and MATLAB, and the error values obtained.
